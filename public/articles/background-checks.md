# Background Checks

This guide explains how to legally conduct background checks on prospective tenants in Colorado.

## Types of Background Checks

When screening potential tenants, landlords typically conduct:
- Credit checks
- Criminal history checks 
- Eviction history
- Income verification
- Rental history verification

ðŸ“‹ **Important:** Background checks must be applied consistently to all applicants to avoid fair housing violations.

## Credit Report Guidelines

Credit reports provide insight into an applicant's financial responsibility:
- You must have the applicant's written consent before pulling a credit report
- If you deny an application based on credit information, you must provide an adverse action notice
- Specify your minimum credit score requirements in writing before collecting application fees

**Statute: FCRA (Fair Credit Reporting Act) 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681**

## Criminal Background Checks

When considering criminal history:
- Focus only on convictions, not arrests
- Consider the nature of the offense and time since the conviction
- Avoid blanket policies against all criminal histories as they may violate fair housing laws
- Evaluate each applicant individually

âœ… **Best practice:** Create a written policy that clearly states how criminal history factors into your decision-making process.

## Legal Considerations

To comply with Colorado law when conducting background checks:
- Obtain written consent for all checks
- Apply the same screening criteria to all applicants
- Maintain confidentiality of all information obtained
- Properly dispose of sensitive applicant information when no longer needed

ðŸš« **Avoid discrimination** based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, familial status, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity.
