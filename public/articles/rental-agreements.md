# Rental Agreements

A well-crafted rental agreement protects both landlords and tenants by clearly establishing rights and responsibilities. This guide covers key requirements for Colorado rental agreements.

## Required Terms in Colorado Leases

All Colorado rental agreements should include:
- Names of all parties (landlord and tenants)
- Property address and description
- Rental amount and due date
- Security deposit amount and conditions for return
- Lease term (start and end dates)
- Maintenance responsibilities
- Utility responsibilities

ðŸ“‹ **Important:** If you charge a late fee, Colorado requires specific disclosures about the fee structure and timing.

## Colorado-Specific Clauses

The following provisions are specific to Colorado law:
- Security deposit return timeline (legally 60 days maximum)
- Non-refundable fees must be clearly labeled as such
- Medical marijuana accommodation policies
- Bed bug disclosure requirements
- Lead-based paint disclosure (for pre-1978 housing)

**Statute: Colo. Rev. Stat. Â§ 38-12-103** (Security deposit requirements)

## Prohibited Lease Terms

Avoid including these illegal clauses in your Colorado lease:
- Waiver of landlord's duty to maintain habitable premises
- Waiver of tenant's right to a security deposit return
- Blanket waiver of liability for injuries on the premises
- Automatic forfeiture of security deposit as "liquidated damages"

ðŸš« **Warning:** Including illegal provisions may make your entire lease unenforceable.

## Amendments & Extensions

When modifying or extending a lease:
- All changes must be in writing and signed by all parties
- Lease renewals should be offered in writing 30-60 days before expiration
- Month-to-month tenancies require 21 days' notice for any changes

âœ… **Best practice:** Have an attorney review your standard lease agreement annually to ensure compliance with changing Colorado laws.
