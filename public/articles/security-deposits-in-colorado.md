# Security Deposits in Colorado

Colorado law provides specific regulations regarding security deposits, protecting both landlords and tenants. This guide explains the key rules and requirements.

## Maximum Amount

While Colorado law doesn't set a maximum limit on security deposits, they must be reasonable. Most landlords typically charge between one to two months' rent.

## Return Timeline

Landlords must return the security deposit within one month after the termination of the lease or surrender and acceptance of the premises, unless the lease specifically provides for a longer period, which cannot exceed 60 days.

**Statute: Colo. Rev. Stat. Â§ 38-12-103**

## Allowable Deductions

Landlords can make deductions from the security deposit for:
- Unpaid rent
- Damages beyond normal wear and tear
- Other breaches of the lease agreement

ðŸ“‹ **Important:** Normal wear and tear cannot be deducted from the security deposit. This includes reasonable wear from everyday living.

## Documentation Requirements

If the landlord withholds any portion of the security deposit, they must provide the tenant with a written statement listing the exact reasons for the retention within the same time period required for the return.

**Statute: Colo. Rev. Stat. Â§ 38-12-103(1)**

## Interest on Deposits

Colorado state law does not require landlords to pay interest on security deposits. However, some local ordinances (like Boulder) may have different requirements.

âœ… **Best practice:** Check your local city or county regulations for any additional requirements regarding security deposits.

## Legal Recourse

If a landlord fails to provide the written statement of withholding or return the deposit within the required timeframe, the tenant may be entitled to:
- The full deposit amount
- Attorney fees
- Treble damages (three times the amount wrongfully withheld)

## Pet Deposits

As of 2024, landlords cannot demand or receive a pet deposit or additional security deposit of more than $300 for a pet animal. This deposit must be:
- Fully refundable
- Used only for damage caused by the pet
- Separate from the standard security deposit

**Statute: Colo. Rev. Stat. Â§ 38-12-106**
