# Applications & Screening

This guide covers what landlords can and cannot ask during the application process, along with Colorado regulations on application fees and screening criteria.

## What You Can and Can't Ask

You can ask about:
- Employment and income
- Rental history
- References
- Pets
- Smoking

You cannot ask questions that could violate fair housing laws, such as:
- Race, religion, or national origin
- Disability (including mental health)
- Familial status (e.g., "Do you have kids?")
- Gender identity or sexual orientation

🚫 **Avoid questions** that indirectly reveal protected characteristics (e.g., "What church do you attend?")

## Application Fee Limits

Colorado does not cap application fees, but:
- You must charge only the actual cost of processing the application (e.g., background checks)
- You must disclose the amount in writing, along with what the fee covers

**Statute: Colo. Rev. Stat. § 38-12-903**

## Screening Criteria + Disclosures

Under Colorado law, you must disclose your rental criteria in writing before accepting any application fee. This includes:
- Income requirements
- Credit score minimums
- Criminal background restrictions
- Rental history standards

Tenants must be told what factors will lead to denial — this allows them to make an informed choice before applying.

**Statute: Colo. Rev. Stat. § 38-12-904**

✅ **Best practice:** Provide a one-pager titled "Rental Requirements & Process" along with every application.
