# 📝 Rental Agreements (Colorado)

## Required Lease Terms

Colorado does **not require a written lease**, but a written agreement is highly recommended to protect both parties.

Include:
- Names of all tenants and occupants  
- Lease start and end dates  
- Rent amount, due date, and payment method  
- Security deposit terms  
- Utilities: who pays for what  
- Maintenance responsibilities  
- Pet rules  
- Notice requirements for ending the lease  

## Lease Types

Colorado allows:
- **Fixed-term leases** (e.g., 12-month lease)  
- **Month-to-month leases** (renew automatically each month)  

> 🔁 **Tip:** The lease type will affect how much notice you or the tenant need to give when ending the tenancy.

## Statutory Language Required

Colorado law doesn’t mandate specific lease wording, but leases must comply with relevant rental laws, including:

- Security deposit return rules (_Colo. Rev. Stat. § 38-12-103_)  
- Warranty of habitability requirements (_Colo. Rev. Stat. § 38-12-505_)  
- Bedbug disclosure requirements (_Colo. Rev. Stat. § 38-12-1002_)

> ✅ **Best practice:** If you’re using a lease template, make sure it’s designed for Colorado and regularly reviewed for updates in local law.
