Applications & Screening
What You Can and Can’t Ask
You can ask about:
	•	Employment and income
	•	Rental history
	•	References
	•	Pets
	•	Smoking
You cannot ask questions that could violate fair housing laws, such as:
	•	Race, religion, or national origin
	•	Disability (including mental health)
	•	Familial status (e.g., “Do you have kids?”)
	•	Gender identity or sexual orientation
🚫 Avoid questions that indirectly reveal protected characteristics (e.g., “What church do you attend?”)

Application Fee Limits
Colorado does not cap application fees, but:
	•	You must charge only the actual cost of processing the application (e.g., background checks)
	•	You must disclose the amount in writing, along with what the fee covers
Statute: Colo. Rev. Stat. § 38-12-903

Screening Criteria + Disclosures
Under Colorado law, you must disclose your rental criteria in writing before accepting any application fee. This includes:
	•	Income requirements
	•	Credit score minimums
	•	Criminal background restrictions
	•	Rental history standards
Tenants must be told what factors will lead to denial — this allows them to make an informed choice before applying.
Statute: Colo. Rev. Stat. § 38-12-904
✅ Best practice: Provide a one-pager titled "Rental Requirements & Process" along with every application.
