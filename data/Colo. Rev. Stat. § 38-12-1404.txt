Current through 11/5/2024 election
Section 38-12-1404 - Concurrent mobile home leases
(1) For a rent-to-own contract covered under this part 14, the seller must offer the purchaser a mobile home lease for a period equivalent to the period in which the purchaser has to complete the purchase of the mobile home.
(2) For a rent-to-own contract when the seller is the owner of more than one mobile home within the same mobile home park and is not the landlord of the park, the seller shall not enter into a rent-to-own contract unless the seller's rental agreement with the landlord of the mobile home park or any binding addendum to the rental agreement specifically permits the seller to sublease and sell the mobile home and the seller has satisfied any requirements of the landlord of the mobile home park related to sublessees and the sale of mobile homes. If a seller fails to satisfy the requirements of this subsection (2), the rent-to-own contract is invalid and unenforceable by the seller, and the seller must return to the purchaser, within ten calendar days, any purchase payments and any other money that the seller has received from the purchaser.
(3) A mobile home lease must be a separate document from the rent-to-own contract.
