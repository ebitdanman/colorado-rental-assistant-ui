Section 38-12-201.3 - Legislative declaration - increased availability of mobile home parks
The general assembly hereby finds and declares that mobile homes, manufactured housing, and factory-built housing are important and effective ways to meet Colorado's affordable housing needs. The general assembly further finds and declares that, because of the unique aspects of mobile homes and mobile home park ownership, there is a need to protect mobile home owners from eviction with short notice so as to prevent mobile home owners from losing their shelter as well as any equity in their mobile homes. The general assembly encourages local governments to allow and protect mobile home parks in their jurisdictions and to enact plans to increase the number of mobile home parks in their jurisdictions. The general assembly further encourages local governments to provide incentives to mobile home park owners to attract additional mobile home parks and to increase the viability of current parks.

Section 38-12-202 - Tenancy - notice to terminate tenancy
(1)
(a) Tenancy or other lease or rental occupancy of space in a mobile home park may not commence without a written lease or rental agreement, and tenancy in a mobile home park shall not be terminated until a notice to terminate tenancy or notice of nonpayment of rent has been served. A notice to terminate tenancy must be in writing and include a description of the property. The property description is legally sufficient if it states:
(I) The name of the landlord or the mobile home park;
(II) The mailing address of the property;
(III) The location or space number upon which the mobile home is situate; and
(IV) The county in which the mobile home is situate.
(b) Service of the notice to terminate tenancy must be as specified in section 13-40-108. Service by posting is deemed legally sufficient within the meaning of section 13-40-108 if the notice is affixed to the main entrance of the mobile home.
(c)
(I) Except as otherwise provided in section 38-12-204 (1) or subsections (1)(c)(II) and (3) of this section, the management shall give a home owner at least ninety days after the date the notice is served or posted to sell the mobile home or remove it from the premises.
(II) If management terminates a tenancy on grounds described in section 38-12-203 (1)(f), the management shall give the home owner at least ten days after the date the notice is served or posted to sell the mobile home or remove it from the premises.
(2) Repealed.
(3) In any notice provided by the management as required by this section, the management shall specify the reason for the termination, as described in section 38-12-203, of the tenancy that is the subject of the notice.

Rent payment and other agreed tenant obligations remain in effect during this ninety-day period, and acceptance of rent by a landlord during this ninety-day period does not constitute a waiver of the landlord's right to terminate the tenancy for any noncompliance described in section 38-12-203 (1)(a) or (1)(c).
(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, in any action to terminate a home owner's tenancy based on a violation described in section 38-12-203 (1)(a), the periods of time set forth in this section to provide home owners notice or a right to cure are superseded by any local ordinances, state laws or rules, or court orders that require a home owner's compliance within a shorter time period.

Colo. Rev. Stat. § 38-12-203.5
Current through 11/5/2024 election
Section 38-12-203.5 - Change in use of the park - remedies for home owners - definitions
(1) As used in this section, unless the context otherwise requires:
(a) "In-place fair market value" means the fair market value of the mobile home and any attached appurtenances and structures on the lot owned by the home owner such as porches, decks, skirting, awnings, and sheds, taking into account the actual cost of all improvements made to the mobile home by the home owner. Fair market value is determined based on the value of the mobile home in its current location prior to the decision to change the use of the park.
(b) "Relocation costs" includes:
(I) Any reasonable costs incurred to move the mobile home, furniture, and personal belongings therein to a replacement site;
(II) The reasonable cost of disassembling, moving, and reassembling any attached appurtenances and structures on the lot owned by the home owner such as porches, decks, skirting, awnings, and sheds, which were not acquired by the landlord;
(III) The costs of anchoring the unit;
(IV) The costs of connecting or disconnecting the mobile home to utilities;
(V) Insurance coverage during transport; and
(VI) The cost to disassemble and reinstall any accessibility improvements such as wheelchair ramps, lifts, and grab bars.
(2) If a landlord intends to change the use of the land comprising a mobile home park or part of a mobile home park or the mobile home park is condemned for reasons that are the responsibility of the park owner and the change in use or condemnation would result in the displacement of one or more mobile homes in the park, for each displaced mobile home, the landlord shall provide the home owner or home owners one of the following at the home owner's or home owners' choosing within thirty days of receiving a written demand by the home owner or home owners:
(a) Payment of relocation costs to relocate the mobile home to a location of the home owner's choosing within one hundred miles by road of the park. Relocation costs are determined based on the lowest estimate obtained by the home owner from a mobile home mover. The landlord may request a copy of the estimate to support the request for payment of relocation costs. If the home owner exercises this option, the home owner must actually relocate the mobile home and all personal belongings in accordance with the estimate used to determine relocation costs prior to the date of the change in use set forth in the notice required by section 38-12-203 (1)(d)(II). The home owner is responsible for additional mileage costs to move the mobile home to a location more than one hundred miles from the park.
(b) Submission of a binding offer to purchase the mobile home for the greater of:
(I) Seven thousand five hundred dollars for a single-section mobile home or ten thousand dollars for a multi-section mobile home; or
(II) One hundred percent of the in-place fair market value as determined through the appraisal process set forth in this subsection (2)(b)(II). Within thirty days of submitting the offer, the landlord shall hire a licensed, certified residential, or certified general appraiser from the active appraisers list published by the division of real estate in the department of regulatory agencies to conduct the appraisal. If the home owner disputes the appraised value of the mobile home, the home owner may hire a licensed, certified residential, or certified general appraiser from the active appraisers list to obtain a second appraisal at the home owner's expense. To be considered, the home owner must obtain the appraisal within sixty days of receipt of the landlord's appraisal. The results of all appraisals shall be provided in writing by the appraiser to both landlord and home owner. If a second appraisal is obtained, the home owner is entitled to the average of the appraisals obtained by the landlord and the home owner. If the home owner is not satisfied with the appraisal or appraisals received, the home owner may submit a request for payment of relocation costs as set forth in subsection (2)(a) of this section. If the home owner exercises the option for purchase under this subsection (2)(b)(II), the sale closing must occur prior to the date of the change in use set forth in the notice provided pursuant to section 38-12-203 (1)(d)(II).
(3) If an appraiser conducting an appraisal pursuant to subsection (2)(b)(II) of this section identifies lack of maintenance, deferred maintenance, or deterioration of the mobile home park beyond normal wear and tear that negatively affects the value of a mobile home, the appraiser shall determine the value of the home with an upward adjustment in value if necessary to eliminate the negative effect in value caused by the lack of maintenance, deferred maintenance, or deterioration of the park beyond normal wear and tear.
(4) On July 1, 2024, and on July 1 of each year thereafter, the department shall adjust the amount specified in subsection (2)(b)(I) of this section in accordance with the percentage change for the previous twelve months at the time of the calculation in the United States department of labor, bureau of labor statistics, consumer price index for Denver-Aurora-Lakewood for all items and all urban consumers, or its successor index. The department shall publish the adjusted amount on the department's website.
(5) A home owner is entitled to the remedies provided under this section only if the home owner has not given notice to terminate the home owner's lease or rental agreement as of the date of the notice of the change in use.
(6) Any agreement made with a home owner to waive any rights under this section is invalid and ineffective for any purpose.

(b) Has any unpaid penalties owed to the division of housing;
(c)
(I) Has not fully complied with any government order.

(e) Has been found by the division in a final agency order or by a court, within the twelve months prior to the final agency or court order, to have failed to comply with a landlord's responsibilities pursuant to section 38-12-212.3. This subsection (4)(e) shall not apply to a negotiated settlement that precedes a final agency or court order.
(5) A notice of a rent increase issued in violation of this section is invalid and has no force and effect.

Colo. Rev. Stat. § 38-12-204.3
Current through 11/5/2024 election
Section 38-12-204.3 - Notice required for termination
(1) Where the tenancy of a mobile home owner is being terminated under section 38-12-202 or section 38-12-204, the landlord or mobile home park owner shall provide such mobile home owner with written notice as provided for in subsection (2) of this section. Service of such notice must occur at the same time and in the same manner as service of:
(a) The notice to terminate tenancy as provided in section 38-12-202 (1); or
(b) The notice of nonpayment of rent as provided in section 38-12-204 (1).
(2) The notice required under this section must be provided pursuant to section 38-12-212.9 in at least twelve-point type and must read as follows:
IMPORTANT NOTICE TO THE HOME OWNER:

This notice and the accompanying notice to terminate tenancy/notice of nonpayment of rent are the first steps in the eviction process. Any dispute you may have regarding the grounds for eviction should be addressed with your landlord or the management of the mobile home park or in the courts if an eviction action is filed. Please be advised that the "Mobile Home Park Act", part 2 of article 12 of title 38, Colorado Revised Statutes, and the "Mobile Home Park Act Dispute Resolution and Enforcement Program" created in section 38-12-1104, Colorado Revised Statutes, may provide you with legal protection.

NOTICE TO TERMINATE TENANCY: In order to terminate a home owner's tenancy, the landlord or management of a mobile home park must serve to a home owner a notice to terminate tenancy. The notice must be in writing and must contain certain information, including:

. The grounds for the termination of the tenancy;

. Whether or not the home owner has a right to cure under the "Mobile Home Park Act"; and

. That the home owner has the option of mediation pursuant to section 38-12-216, Colorado Revised Statutes, of the "Mobile Home Park Act" and the option of filing a complaint through the "Mobile Home Park Act Dispute Resolution and Enforcement Program" created in section 38-12-1104, Colorado Revised Statutes.

NOTICE OF NONPAYMENT OF RENT: In order to terminate a home owner's tenancy due to nonpayment of rent, the landlord or management of a mobile home park must serve to a home owner a notice of nonpayment of rent. The notice must be in writing and must require that the home owner either make payment of rent or sell the owner's unit or remove it from the premises within a period of not less than ten days after the date the notice is served or posted, for failure to pay rent when due.

CURE PERIODS: If the home owner has a right to cure under the "Mobile Home Park Act", the landlord or management of a mobile home park cannot terminate a home owner's tenancy without first providing the home owner with a time period to cure the noncompliance. "Cure" refers to a home owner remedying, fixing, or otherwise correcting the situation or problem that made the tenancy subject to termination pursuant to sections 38-12-202, 38-12-203, or 38-12-204, Colorado Revised Statutes.

COMMENCEMENT OF LEGAL ACTION TO TERMINATE THE TENANCY: After the last day of the applicable notice period required by section 38-12-202 (1)(c), Colorado Revised Statutes, a legal action may be commenced to take possession of the space leased by the home owner. In order to evict a home owner, the landlord or management of the mobile home park must prove:

. The landlord or management complied with the notice requirements of the "Mobile Home Park Act";

. The landlord or management provided the home owner with a statement of reasons for termination of the tenancy; and

. The reasons for termination of the tenancy are true and valid under the "Mobile Home Park Act".

To defend against an eviction action, a home owner must appear in court. If the court rules in favor of the landlord or management of the mobile home park, the home owner has not less than thirty days from the time of the ruling to either remove or sell the mobile home and to vacate the premises. If the home owner wishes to extend such period beyond thirty days but not more than sixty days from the date of the ruling, the home owner shall prepay to the landlord an amount equal to a pro rata share of rent for each day following the expiration of the initial thirty-day period after the court's ruling that the mobile home owner will remain on the premises. All prepayments shall be paid no later than thirty days after the court ruling. This section does not preclude earlier removal by law enforcement officers of a mobile home or one or more mobile home owners or occupants from the mobile home park if a mobile home owner violates article 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, or 18 of title 18 or section 16-13-303, Colorado Revised Statutes.

Current through 11/5/2024 election
Section 38-12-208 - Remedies
(1)
(a) Upon granting judgment for possession by the landlord in a forcible entry and detainer action, the court shall immediately issue a writ of restitution which the landlord shall take to the sheriff. In addition, if a money judgment has been requested in the complaint and if service was accomplished by personal service, the court shall determine and enter judgment for any amounts due to the landlord and shall calculate a pro rata daily rent amount that must be paid for the home to remain in the park. The court may rely upon information provided by the landlord or the landlord's attorney when determining the pro rata daily rent amount to be paid by the home owner. Upon receipt of the writ of restitution, the sheriff shall serve notice in accordance with the requirements of section 13-40-108, C.R.S., to the home owner of the court's decision and entry of judgment.
(b) The notice of judgment must state that, at a specified time not less than thirty days from the entry of judgment, which may be extended to not more than sixty days after the entry of judgment if the home owner has prepaid no later than thirty days after the court ruling to the landlord an amount equal to a pro rata share of rent for each day following the expiration of the initial thirty-day period after the court's ruling that the mobile home owner will remain on the premises, and in instances where the mobile home must be removed from the mobile home lot, the sheriff shall return to serve a writ of restitution and superintend the peaceful and orderly removal of the mobile home under that order of court. The notice of judgment must also advise the home owner, in instances where the mobile home must be removed from the mobile home lot, to prepare the mobile home for removal from the premises by removing the skirting, disconnecting utilities, attaching tires, and otherwise making the mobile home safe and ready for highway travel.
(c) Should the home owner fail to have the mobile home safe and ready for physical removal from the premises or should inclement weather or other unforeseen problems occur at the time specified in the notice of judgment, the landlord and the sheriff may, by written agreement, extend the time for the execution of the writ of restitution to allow time for the landlord to arrange to have the necessary work done or to permit the sheriff's execution of the writ of restitution at a time when weather or other conditions will make removal less hazardous to the mobile home.
(d) If the mobile home is not removed from the landlord's land on behalf of the mobile home owner within the time permitted by the writ of restitution, then the landlord and the sheriff shall have the right to take possession of the mobile home for the purposes of removal and storage. The liability of the landlord and the sheriff in such event shall be limited to gross negligence or willful and wanton disregard of the property rights of the home owner. The responsibility to prevent freezing and to prevent wind and weather damage to the mobile home lies exclusively with those persons who have a property interest in the mobile home; except that the landlord may take appropriate action to prevent freezing, to prevent wind and weather damage, and to prevent damage caused by vandals.
(e) Reasonable removal and storage charges and the costs associated with preventing damage caused by wind, weather, or vandals can be paid by any party in interest. Those charges will run with the mobile home, and whoever ultimately claims the mobile home will owe that sum to the person who paid it.
(2)
(a) Prior to the issuance of said writ of restitution, the court shall make a finding of fact based upon evidence or statements of counsel that there is or is not a security agreement on the mobile home being subjected to the writ of restitution. A written statement on the mobile home owner's application for tenancy with the landlord that there is no security agreement on the mobile home shall be prima facie evidence of the nonexistence of such security agreement.

(B) Each pad space is connected to a sewage disposal system approved under applicable law; and
(C) Running water and reasonable amounts of water are furnished at all times to each utility pedestal or pad space; except that a landlord need not satisfy the conditions described in this subsection (1)(a)(III)(C) if a mobile home is individually metered and the tenant occupying the mobile home fails to pay for water services; the local government in which the mobile home park is situated shuts off water service to a mobile home for any reason; a third-party water provider shuts off water for the mobile home park for any reason that is unrelated to the landlord's actions or inactions; weather conditions present a likelihood that water pipes will freeze, water pipes to a mobile home are wrapped in heated pipe tape, and the utility company has shut off electrical service to a mobile home for any reason or the heat tape malfunctions for any reason; running water is not available for any other reason outside the landlord's control to prevent through reasonable and timely maintenance; or the landlord is making repairs or improvements to the items described in subsection (1)(a)(II) of this section, the landlord has provided reasonable advance notice to the mobile home residents of a service disruption that is required in connection with the repairs or improvements, and the service disruption continues for no longer than twenty-four hours.

(III) The landlord shall reimburse residents for any damages to their persons or property, for any loss of use of their property, and for any expenses that they reasonably incur as a result of the failure.
(c) A landlord shall give a minimum of forty-eight hours' notice to residents if water service will be disrupted for more than two hours for planned improvements, maintenance, or repairs. The landlord shall attempt to give a reasonable amount of notice to residents if water service will be disrupted for any other reasons unless conditions are such that providing the notice would result in property damage, health, or safety concerns or when conditions otherwise require emergency repair.
(d) In addition to the requirements of subsection (1)(b) of this section, a landlord must also provide a resident with potable water reasonably sufficient for drinking, cooking, bathing, and all other essential hygiene within the time frames specified in subsection (1)(b)(II) of this section if the mobile home park or the resident or home owner's lot in the park is subject to a boil water advisory that was caused due to maintenance or repairs to the park performed or ordered by a park owner or a park owner's agent or contractor until the advisory has been rescinded by the issuing agency. A landlord shall also provide a notice, posted in a conspicuous place on each mobile home lot in both English and Spanish, of a boil water advisory as soon as possible but not later than twenty-four hours after the landlord receives the boil water advisory.

(3) A landlord shall not require a resident to assume any of the responsibilities described in subsection (1) or (2) of this section as a condition of tenancy in the park.

A landlord shall not evict or otherwise penalize a home owner for requesting a rental agreement for a fixed period.
(c) A landlord may, in the landlord's discretion, allow a lease for a fixed period of longer than one year. In such circumstances, the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection (4) shall not apply.

(d) That authorizes a third person to confess judgment on a claim that arises from the rental agreement, this part 2, or part 11 of this article 12.
(6) Any provision of a rental agreement that is prohibited by subsection (5) of this section is against public policy, unenforceable, and void.
(7) It is a violation of this part 2 for the management to require a home owner to sign a new lease or agreement in violation of this section or to mislead a home owner about the home owner's obligation to sign a new lease or agreement.

Colo. Rev. Stat. § 38-12-214
Current through 11/5/2024 election
Section 38-12-214 - Rules and regulations - amendments - notice - complaints
(1) The management shall adopt written rules and regulations concerning residents' or home owners' use and occupancy of the premises. The management shall provide a resident or home owner with a written copy of the adopted rules and regulations in English and Spanish. Except as otherwise provided in this section, such rules and regulations are enforceable against a resident or home owner only if:
(a) Their purpose is to promote the safety or welfare of the home owners, protect and preserve the premises from abuse, or make a fair distribution of services and facilities held out for the home owners generally;
(b) They are reasonably related to a legitimate purpose, for which they are adopted;
(c) They are not arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, retaliatory, or discriminatory in nature;
(d) They are sufficiently explicit in prohibition, direction, or limitation of each home owner's conduct to fairly inform each home owner of what the home owner must do or not do to comply; and
(e) They are established in the rental agreement at the inception of the tenancy, amended subsequently with the written consent of the home owner, or, except as described in subsection (2) of this section, amended subsequently without the written consent of the home owner after the management has provided written notice, in both English and Spanish, of the amendments to the home owner in a common area and in a conspicuous place on each home owner's mobile home lot at least sixty days before the amendments become effective, and, if applicable, enforced in compliance with subsection (3) of this section.
(2)
(a) When a mobile home or any accessory building or structure is owned by a person other than the owner of the mobile home park in which the mobile home is located, the mobile home and the accessory building or structure are each a separate unit of ownership. The accessory building or structure are each presumed to be owned by the owner of the mobile home unless there is a written agreement establishing ownership by another person.
(b) If a rule or regulation requires a home owner to incur a cost or imposes restrictions or requirements on the home owner's right to control what happens in or to the mobile home or any accessory building or structure, the rule or regulation is presumed unreasonable pursuant to subsection (1)(c) of this section unless management demonstrates that the rule or regulation:
(I) Is strictly necessary to protect the health and safety of park residents and the rule or regulation provides the protection at the lowest expense to home owners as is reasonably possible;
(II) Is strictly necessary to comply with or enforce a federal, state, or local government requirement, including local nuisance laws enforced for the welfare of other residents;
(III) Is voluntarily agreed to by the home owner, without coercion or misrepresentation by management, in which case the rule or regulation is only binding upon home owners who have communicated their written consent to the rule or regulation; or
(IV) In a mobile home park managed by home owners, was established by the managing home owner organization in accordance with the organization's bylaws and more than fifty percent of the home owners are members of the organization.
(c)
(I) Rules or regulations that impose restrictions or requirements on the home owner's right to control what happens in or to a home owner's mobile home or any accessory building or structure include, but are not limited to, those that impose requirements related to the following:
(A) The structure and appearance of the mobile home, building, or structure, including rules or regulations requiring aesthetic improvements;
(B) Who may visit the mobile home, building, or structure, or who may reside at the mobile home;
(C) Lawful activities taking place in the mobile home, building, or structure; and
(D) Resident occupancy limits that are stricter than applicable federal, state, and local occupancy laws.
(II) This subsection (2)(c) does not preclude a landlord from conducting any lawful screening of a rental application.
(d) Beginning on June 4, 2024, any notice to quit served pursuant to section 38-12-204.3 or any complaint to terminate tenancy pursuant to section 38-12-203 (1)(c) shall include a statement that specifically sets forth the basis for enforceability pursuant to subsection (1) of this section and section 38-12-203 (1)(c), including the specific purpose required pursuant to subsection (1)(a) of this section and how the rule or regulation is reasonably related to the stated purpose as required pursuant to subsection (1)(b) of this section. A general statement that a rule or regulation promotes safety or welfare is not sufficient to meet the requirements of this subsection (2)(d) or section 38-12-203 (1)(c).
(e) The division is authorized to promulgate rules that:
(I) Specify additional park rules and regulations that are not strictly necessary pursuant to this section and are unenforceable or presumptively unenforceable; and
(II) Specify additional park rules and regulations that are strictly necessary pursuant to this section and are enforceable or presumptively enforceable.
(2.5)
(a) Subsection (2) of this section does not prohibit the management from requiring compliance by a new home owner with park rules and regulations that were not enforceable against the previous home owner after the sale or transfer of a mobile home or accessory building or structure as described in subsection (2.5)(b) of this section if the rules or regulations comply with this section and have been duly noticed, in both English and Spanish, to all home owners and residents, including the seller, pursuant to subsection (1)(e) of this section; except that, as used in this subsection (2.5), "transfer" does not include a transfer of ownership pursuant to death or divorce or a transfer of ownership to a new co-owner who is an immediate family member, spouse, or domestic partner of the home owner.
(b) The management shall not require a home owner selling a mobile home or accessory building or structure to ensure that the mobile home or accessory building or structure complies with any rules or regulations by the closing date of the sale or to bear the costs of compliance with any such rules or regulations. If the management requires all prospective buyers to comply with such rules and regulations as a condition of gaining tenancy in the park, the management shall promptly provide a written list of items for which the management requires action to the seller upon receiving notice that the mobile home is for sale. The seller shall provide the list to all prospective buyers, and the management shall provide the list to the buyer upon receiving an application for tenancy. The management shall allow a reasonable amount of time after closing for the buyer to bring the mobile home or accessory building or structure into compliance, which must be at least thirty days from the closing date. During the period in which the buyer may bring the mobile home or accessory building or structure into compliance, the management shall provide the buyer with reasonable access to the mobile home or accessory building or structure, including access to the mobile home or accessory building or structure for the purpose of storing belongings until the buyer is able to reside in the mobile home.
(2.7)
(a) Notwithstanding any rental agreement, the management shall not interfere with a home owner's right to sell a mobile home or accessory building or structure, in place or otherwise, to a buyer of the home owner's choosing, regardless of the age of the home, except as necessary for the management to ensure:
(I) Compliance with park-wide affordability restrictions, including requirements for owner occupancy;
(II) The financial ability of the home buyer to comply with the buyer's obligations as a new tenant pursuant to subsection (2.7)(c) of this section;
(III) Compliance with applicable local, state, or federal law; and
(IV) The absence of a home buyer's relevant criminal history that would indicate a reasonable chance of risk to other residents in accordance with section 38-12-904 (1)(b).
(b) A provision in a rental agreement that limits or restricts a home owner's right to sell a mobile home or accessory building or structure to a buyer of the home owner's choosing other than as allowed by this subsection (2.7) is unenforceable.
(c) A buyer demonstrates the buyer's financial ability to comply with the provisions of subsection (2.7)(a)(II) of this section if the buyer can demonstrate that:
(I) The buyer has a monthly income that is at least two hundred percent of the seller's current monthly lot rent for one month; or
(II) The buyer has other cash assets that are at least two hundred percent of the seller's current monthly lot rent for six months.
(3)
(a) If the management provides each home owner written notice, in both English and Spanish, of the management's intent to add or amend any written rule or regulation as described in subsection (1)(e) of this section, or if the management indicates that it will begin enforcing a rule or regulation that was previously unenforced, a home owner may file a complaint challenging the rule, regulation, or amendment pursuant to section 38-12-1105 within sixty days after receiving the notice. If a home owner files such a complaint and the new or amended rule or regulation will increase a cost to the home owner in an amount that equals or exceeds ten percent of the home owner's monthly rent obligation under the rental agreement, the management shall not enforce the rule, regulation, or amendment unless and until the parties reach an agreement concerning the rule, regulation, or amendment or the dispute resolution process concludes and the division issues a written determination, pursuant to section 38-12-1105 (4), that the rule, regulation, or amendment does not constitute a violation of this part 2 and may be enforced. Notwithstanding any provision of part 11 of this article 12 to the contrary, as part of the complaint process described in section 38-12-1105, the management has the burden of establishing that the rule, regulation, or amendment satisfies the requirements described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section.
(b) Nothing in this section precludes a home owner from filing a complaint, pursuant to section 38-12-1105, concerning a rule or regulation at any time after the rule or regulation takes effect.
(4) Rules and regulations that concern recreational facilities may be amended at the reasonable discretion of the management.

Section 38-12-217 - Notice of change of use - notice of sale or closure of park - opportunity for home owners to purchase - procedures - exemptions - enforcement - private right of action - definitions
(1) Except as specified in subsection (12) of this section:
(a)
(I) A landlord shall provide notice of the landlord's intent to sell the park within fourteen days of a triggering event demonstrating the landlord's intent to sell. The notice must be given in accordance with the requirements of subsection (2) of this section.
(II) A triggering event requiring notice under this subsection (1)(a) includes any time the landlord:
(A) Signs a contract with a real estate broker or brokerage firm to list the park for sale or to sell or transfer the park;
(B) Signs a letter of intent, option to sell or buy, or other conditional written agreement with a potential buyer for the sale or transfer of the park, which includes the estimated price, terms, and conditions of the proposed sale or transfer, even if such price, terms, or conditions are subject to change;
(C) Signs a contract with a potential buyer's real estate broker or brokerage firm related to the potential sale or transfer of the park;
(D) Accepts an earnest money promissory note or deposit from a potential buyer for the sale or transfer of the park;
(E) Responds to a potential buyer's due diligence request for the park;
(F) Provides a signed property disclosure form for the park to a potential buyer;
(G) Lists the park for sale;
(H) Makes a conditional acceptance of an offer for the sale or transfer of the park;
(I) Takes any other action demonstrating an intent to sell the park; or
(J) Receives a notice of election and demand or lis pendens related to foreclosure of the park pursuant to part 1 of article 38 of this title 38 or a notice that a certificate of levy has been filed related to the park pursuant to section 13-56-101.
(b) A landlord shall provide notice of the landlord's intent to change the use of the land comprising the mobile home park in accordance with the requirements of subsection (2) of this section at least twelve months before the change in use will occur.
(c) No earlier than ninety days after giving the notice required by subsection (1)(a) of this section, a landlord may post information in a public space in the mobile home park describing the method for providing a signed writing to the mobile home park owner related to the opportunity to purchase. The posting must include standard forms created by the department of local affairs related to the opportunity to purchase and the rights of mobile home park owners related to the opportunity to purchase, including a standardized form developed by the department of local affairs for the landlord to use to request the signatures of home owners who decline to participate in efforts to purchase a community. If, no earlier than ninety days after a landlord provides the notice required by subsection (1)(a) of this section, at least fifty percent of the home owners who reside in the park provide signed writings to the landlord declining to participate in purchasing the park, then the opportunity to purchase provided by subsection (4) of this section terminates even if the one-hundred-twenty-day period provided for in subsection (4)(a) of this section has not yet elapsed.
(d) A landlord shall not solicit or request a home owner's intention or a signed writing related to the opportunity to purchase during the initial ninety days after giving notice pursuant to subsection (1)(a) of this section. During the time period for considering an opportunity to purchase, a landlord shall not attempt to coerce, threaten, or intimidate a home owner or provide any financial or in-kind incentives to a home owner to influence the home owner's vote or decision and shall not take retaliatory action against a home owner after the home owner's vote or decision. Any complaints alleging violation of this subsection (1) may be resolved under part 11 of this article 12 and subsection (15) of this section.
(2)Notice - requirements.
(a) To provide notice as required by subsection (1)(a) or (1)(b) of this section, the landlord shall mail the notice in both English and Spanish by certified mail to:
(I) Each home owner, using the most recent address of the home owner, and shall post a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the mobile home or at the main point of entry to the lot;
(II) The municipality or, if the park is in an unincorporated area, the county within which the park is located;
(III) The division of housing in the department of local affairs; and
(IV) Each home owners' association, residents' association, or similar body that represents the residents of the park.

(II)
(A) Post the notice in both English and Spanish in a clearly visible location in common areas of the mobile home park, including any community hall or recreation hall. The notice must remain publicly posted for a period of at least one hundred twenty days from the date it is posted or until the opportunity to purchase has expired.
(B) The landlord shall make a good faith effort to comply with the notice requirement in subsection (2)(b)(II)(A) of this section. A good faith effort by the landlord to comply with the notice requirement in subsection (2)(b)(II)(A) of this section will not render a sale of a park to be out of compliance with this section.
(3)Contents of notice. The notice given pursuant to subsection (1)(a) of this section must include notice of home owners' rights and remedies under this section. If the triggering event involves a potential sale, the notice must also include a description of the property to be purchased; the price, terms, and conditions of an acceptable offer the landlord has received to sell the mobile home park or the price or terms and conditions for which the landlord intends to sell the park; and any other terms or conditions which, if not met, would be sufficient grounds, in the landlord's discretion, to reject an offer from a group of home owners or their assignees. The price, terms, and conditions stated in the notice must be universal and applicable to all potential buyers and must not be specific to and prohibitive of a group or association of home owners or their assignees making a successful offer to purchase the park. The information regarding the proposed sale and the price, terms, and conditions of an acceptable offer may be shared for the purposes of evaluating or obtaining financing for the prospective transaction, but all persons who receive the information shall otherwise keep it confidential if the landlord or the landlord's agent so requests.
(4)Offer to purchase - who may submit - time limits.
(a) A group or association of home owners or their assignees have one hundred twenty days after the date that the landlord mails a notice required by subsection (1)(a) of this section to:
(I) Submit to the landlord a proposed purchase and sale agreement and obtain an offer for any necessary financing or guarantees; or
(II) Submit to the landlord an assignment agreement pursuant to subsection (8) of this section.
(b) Notwithstanding subsection (4)(a) of this section, if a foreclosure sale of the park is scheduled for less than one hundred twenty days after the landlord mails a notice required by subsection (1)(a) of this section, the opportunity granted by subsection (4)(a) of this section terminates on the date of the foreclosure sale.
(c) A group or association of home owners or their assignees has the opportunity granted by subsection (4)(a) of this section if the group or association of home owners or their assignees have the approval of at least fifty-one percent of the home owners in the park. The group or association of home owners or their assignees must submit to the landlord reasonable evidence that the home owners of at least fifty-one percent of the occupied homes in the park have approved the group or association purchasing the park.
(5)Landlord's duty to consider offer. A landlord that has given notice as required by subsection (1)(a) of this section shall:
(a) Provide documents, data, and other information in response to reasonable requests for information from a group or association of home owners or their assignees participating in the opportunity to purchase that would enable them to prepare an offer. The documents, data, and other information provided may be shared for the purposes of evaluating or obtaining financing for the prospective transaction, but all persons who receive the information shall otherwise keep it confidential if the landlord or the landlord's agent so requests.
(b)
(I) Negotiate in good faith with a group or association of home owners or their assignees.
(II) For purposes of this subsection (5)(b), negotiating in good faith includes, but is not limited to, evaluating an offer to purchase from a group of home owners or their assignees without consideration of the time period for closing, the type of financing or payment method, whether or not the offer is contingent on financing or payment method or whether or not the offer is contingent on financing, an appraisal, or title work; and providing a written response within seven calendar days of receiving an offer from a group of home owners or their assignees. The written response must accept or reject the offer, and if the offer is rejected, must state:
(A) The current price, terms, or conditions of an acceptable offer that the landlord has received to sell the mobile home park if the price, terms, or conditions have changed since the landlord gave notice to the home owners pursuant to subsection (3) of this section; and
(B) Why the landlord is rejecting the offer from a group of home owners and what terms and conditions must be included in a subsequent offer for the landlord to potentially accept it.
(III) The price, terms, and conditions of an acceptable offer stated in the response must be universal and applicable to all potential buyers and must not be specific to and prohibitive of a group or association of home owners or their assignees making a successful offer to purchase the park.
(c) Schedule a closing date for a purchase and sale agreement.
(6)Expiration of opportunity to purchase.
(a) If the one-hundred-twenty-day period provided for in subsection (4)(a) of this section elapses and a group or association of home owners or their assignees have not submitted a proposed purchase and sale agreement or obtained a financial commitment, the group's or association's opportunities provided by this section terminate.
(b) A landlord shall give a group or association of home owners or their assignees an additional one hundred twenty days after the one-hundred-twenty-day period provided by subsection (4)(a) of this section to close on the purchase of the mobile home park.
(7)Extension or tolling of time.
(a) The one-hundred-twenty-day periods described in subsections (4)(a) and (6)(b) of this section may be extended by written agreement between the landlord and the group or association of home owners or their assignees.
(b) The group or association of home owners or their assignees are entitled to tolling of the time periods described in subsections (4)(a) and (6)(b) of this section in any of the following circumstances:
(I) If there is a reasonable delay in obtaining financing or a required inspection or survey of the land that is outside the control of the group or association of home owners or their assignees, the time period is tolled for the duration of the delay;
(II) If the group or association of home owners or their assignee files a nonfrivolous complaint with the department of local affairs alleging a violation of this section, the time period is tolled until the department of local affairs issues a written notice of violation or notice of nonviolation that has become a final agency order determining whether a violation has occurred or the parties reach a resolution by signing a settlement agreement approved by the department of local affairs; and
(III) If the group or association of home owners has attempted to assign their rights pursuant to subsection (8) of this section, the time period is tolled from the time the group or association makes the offer of assignment until the potential assignee either confirms in writing that the offer is rejected or a written assignment contract is executed; except that the time period shall not be tolled for more than ninety days pursuant to this subsection (7)(b)(III).
(8)Assignment of right to purchase.
(a) A group or association of home owners or their assignees that have the opportunity to purchase under subsection (4) of this section may assign their purchase right to a local government, tribal government, housing authority, nonprofit with expertise related to housing, or the state or an agency of the state for the purpose of continuing the use of the park.
(b)
(I) If a group or association of home owners or their assignees comprising more than fifty percent of home owners in a park choose to assign their rights to a public entity under this subsection (8), the home owners or their assignees shall enter into a written assignment contract with the public entity. The assignment contract must include the terms and conditions of the assignment and for how the park will be operated if the public entity purchases the park. The assignment contract must provide that the terms and conditions are applicable to any designee selected by the public entity pursuant to subsection (8)(b)(II) of this section. The terms and conditions may include, but are not limited to:
(A) Any deed restrictions that may be required or permitted regarding the lots or the houses in the park;
(B) Any restrictions on rent or fee increases that apply if the public entity purchases the park;
(C) Any required conditions, such as the required demonstration of approval from home owners, for redeveloping or changing the use of some or all of the park;
(D) A management agreement for how the park will be operated if the public entity purchases the park;
(E) Any changes to park rules or regulations that apply if the public entity purchases the park; and
(F) Any agreement between the parties regarding the transfer of statutory responsibilities associated with managing the park, and any limitations or waivers of liability.
(II) A public entity shall only exercise its right of first refusal for the purpose of preserving the mobile home park as long-term affordable housing. The public entity may designate a housing authority or other political subdivision to purchase the park pursuant to the public entity's right of first refusal for this purpose if the option for a designation is expressly agreed to in the assignment contract.
(III) The public entity or its designee shall promptly provide notice of the assignment contract to the landlord.
(c)
(I) If a landlord receives notice that a group or association of home owners has entered an assignment contract with a public entity pursuant to subsection (8)(b) of this section, the landlord shall provide a right of first refusal to the public entity or its designee. Any purchase and sale agreement entered into by the landlord must be contingent upon the right of first refusal of the public entity or its designee to purchase the mobile home park.
(II) Within thirty days after receiving notice of an assignment contract, the landlord shall provide the public entity or its designee with the terms upon which the landlord would accept an offer to sell the park or a contingent purchase and sale agreement that is effective upon its execution. The public entity has one hundred twenty days from the date the public entity or its designee receives the terms or contingent purchase and sale agreement to notify the landlord of the public entity's intent to purchase the mobile home park or of the public entity's intent to facilitate the purchase of the mobile home park by its designee.
(III) The landlord shall sell the mobile home park to the public entity or its designee if, within the one-hundred-twenty-day period, the public entity or its designee:
(A) Notifies the landlord of its intent to purchase the park or facilitate the purchase of the park by its designee;
(B) Accepts the contingent purchase and sale agreement provided by the landlord or offers the landlord terms that are economically substantially identical to the terms of the contingent purchase and sale agreement or to the terms the landlord provided pursuant to subsection (8)(c)(II) of this section; and
(C) Commits to close within one hundred twenty days from the date the public entity or its designee and the owner sign a purchase and sale agreement.
(IV) For the purpose of determining whether the terms of an offer are economically substantially identical under subsection (8)(c)(III)(B) of this section, it is immaterial how the offer would be financed.
(d) A landlord shall not take any action that would preclude the public entity or its designee from succeeding to the rights of and assuming the obligations of the designee of the terms of the contingency purchase and sale agreement or negotiating with the landlord for the purchase of the mobile home park during the notice periods identified in this section.
(e) In addition to any other times, during the notice periods identified in this section, a public entity may pursue preservation of the mobile home park as affordable housing through negotiation for purchase or through condemnation.
(f) As used in this subsection (8), "public entity" means the state, an agency of the state, a local government, a tribal government, or any political subdivision of the state, a local government, or a tribal government.
(9)Independence of time limits and notice provisions.
(a) Except as provided in subsection (9)(b) of this section, each occurrence of a triggering event listed in subsection (1)(a) of this section creates an independent, one-hundred-twenty-day opportunity to purchase for the group or association of home owners or their assignees. If a one-hundred-twenty-day opportunity to purchase is in effect and a new triggering event occurs, the ongoing one-hundred-twenty-day time period terminates and a new one-hundred-twenty-day time period begins on the latest date on which the landlord gives notice, as required by subsection (1)(a) or (2) of this section, of the new triggering event.
(b) A landlord is not required to provide a new or subsequent notice of intent to sell for each triggering event listed in subsection (1)(a) of this section if:
(I)
(A) The new demonstration of intent occurs within sixty calendar days of the certified mailing of the most recent notice under subsection (2) of this section; and
(B) There are no material changes to the identity of a potential buyer if the landlord has made a conditional agreement with a buyer; to the time when the park is listed for sale; or to the price, terms, and conditions of an acceptable offer the landlord has received to sell the mobile home park or for which the landlord intends to sell the park, which were included in the most recent notice provided pursuant to subsection (1)(a) of this section; or
(II) The landlord is only considering an offer from a group or association of home owners who reside in the park; except that a landlord shall provide a new or subsequent notice if at any point there is a new triggering event specified in subsection (1)(a) of this section involving a different party.
(b.5) Any material change to the price, terms, and conditions of an acceptable offer the landlord has received to sell the mobile home park or for which the landlord intends to sell the park is considered a new triggering event, requiring a new notice pursuant to subsection (1)(a) of this section and creating a new one-hundred-twenty-day time period.
(c) A notice required under this section is in addition to, and does not substitute for or affect, any other notice requirement under this part 2.
(10) A landlord shall not make a final, unconditional acceptance of any offer for the sale or transfer of the park until:
(a) The landlord has considered an offer made by a group or association of home owners or their assignees pursuant to subsections (4), (5), and (8) of this section; or
(b) The applicable period for exercise of the opportunity to purchase has expired pursuant to subsection (6) of this section.
(11)Failure to complete transaction - affidavit of compliance. If the group or association of home owners or their assignees are not the successful purchaser of the park, the landlord shall provide evidence of compliance with this section by filing an affidavit of compliance with:
(a) The municipality or, if the park is in an unincorporated area, the county, within which the park is located; and
(b) The division of housing in the department of local affairs.
(12)Exemptions from notice requirement. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, a landlord is not required to give notice or extend an opportunity to purchase to a group or association of home owners or their assignees if the sale, transfer, or conveyance of the mobile home park is:
(a) To a spouse, a partner in a civil union, or a parent, sibling, aunt, uncle, first cousin, or legally recognized child of the landlord;
(b) To a trust the beneficiaries of which are the spouse, partner in a civil union, or legally recognized children of the landlord;
(c)
(I) To a business entity or trust that the transferring business entity or trust controls, directly or indirectly.
(II) As used in this subsection (12)(c), "controls" means:
(A) Owns entirely as a subsidiary;
(B) Owns a majority interest in; or
(C) Owns as large an ownership interest as any other owner, with a minimum ownership interest of twenty-five percent.
(d) To a family member who is included within the line of intestate succession if the landlord dies intestate;
(e) Between joint tenants or tenants in common; or
(f) Pursuant to eminent domain.
(13) To qualify for an exemption under subsection (12) of this section, a transaction must not be made in bad faith, must be made for a legitimate business purpose or a legitimate familial purpose consistent with the exemptions listed in subsection (12) of this section, and must not be made for the primary purpose of avoiding the opportunity-to-purchase provisions set forth in this section.
(14)Triggering events not essential.
(a) A group or association of home owners or their assignees may submit an offer to purchase to a landlord at any time, even if none of the events listed in subsection (1)(a) of this section has occurred.
(b) The landlord shall consider in good faith any offer made in accordance with subsection (14)(a) of this section.
(15)Penalties and enforcement.
(a)
(I) For purposes of this title 38, the rights accorded to home owners in this section are property interests.
(II) Any title transferred subsequent to the triggering events in subsection (1)(a) of this section is defective unless the property interests of the home owners as set forth in subsection (15)(a)(I) of this section are secured or until an equitable remedy has been provided.
(b) If the division of housing in the department of local affairs receives a complaint filed in accordance with part 11 of this article 12, the division shall investigate the alleged violations at the division's discretion, and, if appropriate, facilitate negotiations between the complainant and respondent in accordance with part 11 of this article 12. The division may also investigate possible violations of this section upon its own initiative. In addition to the remedies described in section 38-12-1105, the division may:
(I) Impose a fine on the seller of the mobile home park in an amount not to exceed thirty percent of the sale or listing price of the park, whichever is greater, which the division shall distribute to the home owners in the park; or
(II) File a civil action for injunctive or other relief in the district court for the district in which the park is located.
(c) Subject to available resources, the attorney general may investigate possible violations of this section. If the attorney general makes a preliminary finding that a landlord or seller of a mobile home park substantially failed to comply with this section, and if continuation of the sale is likely to result in significant harm to the property interests of the home owners as set forth in subsection (15)(a)(II) of this section, the attorney general:
(I) Shall inform the registrar of titles that the home owners with property interests under this section have an adverse claim on the property, which must be recorded on the certificate of title;
(II) May, pursuant to section 38-36-131 and subject to the time limits of section 38-36-132, issue an order providing temporary injunctive relief to preserve the ownership status quo if the order is issued prior to a transfer of title or to revert the ownership to status quo ante subject to the limitations of article 41 of this title 38 if the order is issued after the transfer of title; and
(III) May continue to investigate, negotiate, and, if appropriate, file a civil action to secure and enforce the rights of home owners under this section or to secure an equitable remedy on their behalf.
(d) One or more home owners or their assignees may file a civil action alleging a violation of this section pursuant to section 38-12-220.
