# 🔍 Background Checks (Colorado)

## Credit & Criminal History

Colorado allows landlords to consider:
- Credit reports  
- Eviction records  
- Criminal convictions  

However, you **must apply the same criteria to all applicants** to avoid fair housing violations. Inconsistent use of background checks can be considered discrimination.

## Fair Housing Compliance

Federal and state fair housing laws prohibit discrimination based on:
- Race  
- Color  
- Religion  
- National origin  
- Sex (including gender identity and sexual orientation)  
- Familial status  
- Disability  

In Colorado, **additional protected classes** include:
- **Marital status**  
- **Source of income** (including Section 8 and housing assistance)

> 🛑 **Important:** You **cannot deny** a tenant solely because they use a housing voucher like Section 8.

**Statute:** _Colo. Rev. Stat. § 24-34-502_
