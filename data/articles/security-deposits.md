# 🏦 Security Deposits in Colorado: A Complete Legal Guide for Landlords

## 🔍 What Counts as a Security Deposit?

A **security deposit** is any upfront money you collect to cover potential damage, unpaid rent, or lease violations — regardless of what you call it. This includes:

- “Security deposits”
- “Cleaning deposits”
- “Damage fees”
- Any refundable move-in charge

If the tenant expects it back, it’s a security deposit.

## 💰 Maximum Amounts & Pet Deposits

There’s no legal cap on how much you can charge for a standard security deposit in Colorado.

However, new laws limit what you can charge specifically for pets:

- **Pet deposit:** Max $300, and it must be refundable  
- **Pet rent:** Max $35/month or 1.5% of the tenant’s monthly rent — whichever is greater

> 🐾 **Note:** These limits don’t apply to service animals or emotional support animals, which aren’t considered pets.

## 🧾 What You Can Deduct

You can keep part of a tenant’s deposit for:

- Unpaid rent  
- Damage beyond normal wear and tear  
- Cleaning or repairs that the tenant agreed to pay for  
- Utility bills that the tenant was responsible for  
- If the tenant abandons the property

You **cannot** deduct for **normal wear and tear** — which means deterioration from everyday use that isn’t caused by neglect or damage.

Examples of normal wear:
- Faded paint or small nail holes  
- Light carpet wear  
- Loose door handles or worn appliances

## 📅 When You Must Return It

You must return the tenant’s deposit within **30 days** of move-out — unless your lease allows more time, up to a **maximum of 60 days**.

If you’re keeping any part of the deposit:
- You must send a **written itemized list of deductions**
- Include the remaining balance with that letter
- Send everything to the tenant’s **last known address**

---

## ⚠️ What Happens If You Miss the Deadline

If you don’t send the letter and return the deposit on time, you **forfeit the right to keep any of it**.

If you **intentionally** withhold the deposit without justification:
- The tenant can sue for **triple the amount you wrongfully kept**
- And recover **legal fees and court costs**
- Tenants must first give **7 days’ notice** before suing

In hazardous gas leak situations, if repairs aren’t made within 72 hours and the tenant moves out, you must return the deposit within 72 hours or risk paying **double the amount** owed.

## 🔁 What If the Property Changes Hands?

If you sell or stop managing the property:
- You must either **transfer the deposit to the new landlord and notify the tenant**,  
- Or **return the deposit directly to the tenant**

Once you do one of those two things, you’re no longer liable for the deposit.

## ❌ Illegal Lease Clauses

You cannot include a lease clause that takes away a tenant’s right to their security deposit or limits their ability to sue. Any clause like that is **void and unenforceable**.

Example: “Tenant agrees to waive any claim against landlord for the deposit” — that clause won’t hold up.

## 🧠 Best Practices for Landlords

1. **Use a clear written lease** that outlines deposit terms  
2. **Take move-in photos and document condition**  
3. **Send deductions with photos, receipts, or detailed descriptions**  
4. **Know the 30-day rule** and don’t wait until the last minute  
5. **Avoid charging for normal wear and tear**
